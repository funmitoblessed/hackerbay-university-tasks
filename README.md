## Task 1 - First API

This is a simple NodeJS project created using express. It contains three APIs - two GETs and one POST APIs.

* The First is a simple `GET` API that returns `{status: success}` as response.
* The second is a `POST` API that takes a request payload `{data: 'Any String'}` and returns the same data in the request
* The third API is a `GET` that takes the data saved from the earlier `POST` and responds with `{data: 'Any String'}`
